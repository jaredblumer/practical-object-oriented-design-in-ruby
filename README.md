# Notes from Sandi Metz's book Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby

## SOLID
- Single Responsibilty
- Open-Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Injection

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Law of Demeter
The Law of Demeter recommends that objects should avoid accessing the internal data and methods of other objects. Instead, an object should only interact with its immediate dependencies.

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development
Agile Software Development values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

While there is value in the items on the right, Agile Software Development values items on the left more.

## Agile Principles
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the cystomer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
